## Training code for random grid search
This repository contains the source code for training a random grid search algorithm.
The RGS algorithm is detailed in [this paper by P.C. Bhat, et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09907), and the paper also provides a basic framework available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/hbprosper/RGS).
The package uses CERN's [Root data analysis framework](https://root.cern.ch/) which is the standard toolkit for in LHC physics research.

## Running the analysis
The python script responsible for running the analysis after training is located in the `analysis` subdirectory.
